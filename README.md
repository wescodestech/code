# Embedded/Linux Programming 

This is my personal code repo that I work on in my spare time.

The code here exists mostly from topics that I have an interest in. Some of the projects
have been re-hashes of old school projects that I decided to port or expand upon.

Most of the code here is developed in a Linux environment (Ubuntu/Raspbian)
I also use Mac OSX to work on developement as well.

For building code, direct your working directory to the root of this repository and issue the command
  make all
